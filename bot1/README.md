# TA Challenge

### Design Choices

As the process is simple and small I chose to keep it in one single file. Breaking it in multiple files would compromise readability and add complexity without need.

### Improvements

If I had more time and if it is a production bot I would work on these Items:

* Adjust logging configuration
* Add more logs and log levels
* Implement retries in some steps
* Break it in multiple robocloud robots to separate the steps and use work items tomote the files and payloads between the steps.
* Improve errors and exception handling
*
